# Prosper-Loan-Analysis
This project entails the analysis of a loan company's data, the data set contained 113937 entries arranged in the rows and 81 variables partitioned into columns. Some columns were selected from the dataset for easy exploration. The main feature of interest was the annual percentage rate (BorrowerAPR).
The analysis was guided by a leading question "What factors affects the annual percentage rate (BorrowerAPR)". 
Thus the relationship between BorrowerAPR and loan amount, Prosper score, loan term, employment status were explored. I discovered loan amount is one of the determining factors of BorrowerAPR, as amount increases the BorrowerAPR reduces. The BorrowerRate structure is similar to the BorrowerAPR, BorrowerAPR is BorrowerRate plus other fees and charges. The prosper score which is a determinant of credit worthiness influences the loan amount and resultantly influence the BorrowerAPR. Most people fall under the 36 months loan term category.
